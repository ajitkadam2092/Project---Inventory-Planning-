# Project---Inventory-Planning-

**Problem Statement : **
The spreadsheet shows three color variations of ‘Product X’. It has projections for the stock that will be in the Amazon warehouse and the stock held in a third party warehouse on the 1st May 2020. Stock from the third party warehouse can be sent to Amazon and takes 7 days to arrive.

The sheet also shows the last 7 and 30 days sales for each variant.

The factory that makes this product takes 45 days to manufacture the goods and sea shipping takes 30 days before the products get to the third party warehouse.

We want to place an order with our factory so we’ll have enough stock in Amazon to last until 1st October 2020.

The order will be placed on 1st April 2020.

The product comes in cartons and there are 50 units in each carton.

Please estimate how many cartons should be ordered for each color and show your calculations in your spreadsheet.


**Calculation/Insight :** Please check Excel sheet for the calculation and projected inventory.
